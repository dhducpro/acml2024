## Submission Instructions
Similar to previous years, ACML 2024 has two publication tracks. Authors may submit either to:

* Conference Track: (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).

* Journal Track: (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).

** Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different.  Details to be announced.

## Important Dates (Approximate)

* August-ish 2024: Workshop proposal deadline
